# Maze-Solving-Algorithm

* **mazeMonteCarlo**: An algorithm to solve a maze using random moves. This algorithm minimizes an energy function to reach the destination. To avoid getting trapped in local minima of the energy function, moves are made at random and a move is accepted with a certain probability. The Turtle library is used for visualization.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80163660/208597913-2dc7eedd-2ec8-4f41-946a-00bb725d27d7.png)
